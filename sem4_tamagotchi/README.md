## About the project
- This window application imitates **Tamagotchi** game. The main idea of the game is the same - you have to take care of your pet, but I put some **extra features** which makes game more interactive and atractive. 
- User can add his own food, play with the pet and also go with the pet to the vet. 
- **User has to figure out the character of the pet** (some specific attributes are randomly added in creating process) by observing the statistics. It will be helpful to endure more days.
- There are a few animations dedicated to the specific actions.  

###  **To create the project I used [_QT Creator_](https://www.qt.io/) framework.**

## Features

### How to start?
  User has to create his own account by typing name and password. Then you can choose the pet you want to take care - dog or cat. If you have created account earlier, you can log in.
